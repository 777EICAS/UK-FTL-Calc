# Flight Selection Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the flight selection functionality in the UK FTL Calc app to provide users with easy access to all flights from their uploaded roster without requiring re-upload.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed File Upload Flow
- **Problem**: The FileUploadView was only passing individual selected flights instead of all flights to the callback
- **Solution**: Modified `FileUploadView.swift` to properly pass all parsed flights to the `onFlightsParsed` callback
- **Result**: All flights from the roster are now stored in `viewModel.allImportedFlights` for persistent access

### 2. Enhanced Flight Selection View
- **Improved Title**: Changed from "Select Different Flight" to "Select Flight from Roster"
- **Better Description**: Added clear explanation that all flights from the uploaded roster are available
- **Helpful Tip**: Added message explaining users can access all flights anytime without re-uploading

### 3. Added Flight Count Badge
- **Dynamic Count**: Shows "X of Y flights" to indicate filtered vs. total flights
- **Visual Feedback**: Blue badge with white text for clear visibility

### 4. Implemented Search Functionality
- **Search Bar**: Added search field to filter flights by:
  - Flight number
  - Departure airport
  - Arrival airport
  - Date
- **Real-time Filtering**: Results update as user types
- **Clear Button**: X button to quickly clear search text
- **Smart Empty States**: Different messages for "no flights" vs. "no search results"

### 5. Enhanced Flight Row Display
- **Better Layout**: Vertical layout with clear sections for different information types
- **Route Visualization**: Clear departure → arrival indicator with arrow
- **Date Badge**: Prominent date display in blue badge
- **Time Information**: Organized display of report, takeoff, and landing times
- **Flight Metrics**: Shows flight time and duty time
- **Selection Indicator**: Clear "Select" button with chevron arrow

### 6. Improved User Experience
- **Info Message**: Added helpful message above action buttons explaining the select flight functionality
- **Persistent Access**: Users can now access all flights from their roster anytime
- **No Re-upload Required**: Eliminates the need to re-upload the same roster file
