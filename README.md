- **Weekly Limits**: Maximum 60 hours duty time, 56 hours flight time  
- **Monthly Limits**: Maximum 190 hours duty time, 100 hours flight time
- **Rest Periods**: Standard 11 hours, reduced 10 hours with conditions
- **Consecutive Duty Days**: Maximum 6 consecutive duty days

### üì± User Interface
- **Modern Design**: Clean, intuitive interface following Apple Design Guidelines
- **Real-time Validation**: Input validation with helpful error messages
- **Status Indicators**: Visual compliance status (Compliant/Warning/Non-Compliant)
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized for iPhone and iPad

### üìÖ Calendar Integration
- **Import Flight Data**: Import flight events from iPhone Calendar
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatically extract flight numbers, airports, and times
- **Batch Import**: Select multiple flights for bulk import

### üìä Data Management
- **Flight History**: Track recent flights with detailed records
- **Export Capability**: Export flight data for record keeping
- **Local Storage**: Secure local data storage with UserDefaults

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration

## UK CAA Regulations Implemented

### Daily Limits
- **Maximum Duty Time**: 13 hours in any 24-hour period
- **Single Pilot Operations**: Maximum 8 hours flight time
- **Multi-Pilot Operations**: Maximum 10 hours flight time
- **Rest Period**: Minimum 11 hours (10 hours with conditions)

### Weekly Limits
- **Maximum Duty Time**: 60 hours in any 7 consecutive days
- **Maximum Flight Time**: 56 hours in any 7 consecutive days
- **Consecutive Duty Days**: Maximum 6 consecutive days

### Monthly Limits
- **Maximum Duty Time**: 190 hours in any calendar month
- **Maximum Flight Time**: 100 hours in any calendar month

### Annual Limits
- **Maximum Duty Time**: 2,000 hours in any 12 consecutive months
- **Maximum Flight Time**: 1,000 hours in any 12 consecutive months

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **SwiftUI**: Modern declarative UI framework
- **MVVM Pattern**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Combine**: Reactive programming for data binding
- **EventKit**: Calendar integration for flight data import

### Key Components
- `FTLViewModel`: Main business logic and data management
- `FTLCalculationService`: Comprehensive FTL compliance calculations
- `CalendarImportView`: Calendar integration and flight data parsing
- `SettingsView`: App configuration and regulation reference

### Data Models
- `FlightRecord`: Flight data structure with Codable support
- `PilotType`: Enumeration of pilot roles
- `FTLCalculationResult`: Calculation results with compliance status
- `FatigueRisk`: Fatigue risk assessment model

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements
- iOS 18.5+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `UK FTL Calc.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Select your development team in project settings
4. Build and run on device or simulator

### Permissions
The app requires the following permissions:
- **Calendar Access**: To import flight events from iPhone Calendar
- **Local Storage**: To save flight records and preferences

## Usage Guide

### Manual Flight Entry
1. Select your pilot type (Single Pilot/Multi-Pilot)
2. Enter flight details:
   - Flight number
   - Departure and arrival airports (3-letter codes)
   - Report time, takeoff time, landing time, duty end time
   - Flight time in hours
3. Tap "Calculate FTL" to see compliance results

### Calendar Import
1. Tap "Import Calendar" from the main screen
2. Grant calendar access when prompted
3. Select flight events to import
4. Review and confirm imported data

### Understanding Results
- **Compliant**: All regulations satisfied
- **Warning**: Approaching limits but still compliant
- **Non-Compliant**: Regulation violations detected

### Settings Configuration
- Set default pilot type for new calculations
- Configure time format preferences
- Access UK CAA regulation references
- Manage flight data export/import

## UK CAA Regulation Sources

The app implements regulations from:
- **CAP 371**: Flight Time Limitations
- **EU OPS**: European Union Operations Regulations
- **UK CAA Guidance**: Official UK Civil Aviation Authority guidance

For the most current regulations, always refer to the official UK CAA website: https://www.caa.co.uk
